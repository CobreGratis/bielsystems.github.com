- Eduardo Fiorezi is a member of the ruby comunity since 2006, when Rails was still just a promisse. Time passes by and the language evolution and the interest of writing a good code with a clear readability became his goal, this way he keeps looking for better ways to develop software for the web.
- His hobbie is Jiu-Jitsu, he practices it for more than 5 years, this sport helps him control his mind resulting in an even better code.
