bio:
  - "Fábio is part of the remote team from the south of Brazil that started with programming
    even before he was born: his father was a programmer from the old times of punched cards
    and his brother is also a developer."
  - He had his first contact with development by the time he was 12 when his brother taught
    him some Pascal and later with 14 he built his first website using FrontPage. He has been
    doing a Bachelor on Computer Science for longer than he should and worked for a long
    time as a freelancer.
  - Since 2007, Fábio has been working as a full stack developer on a wide range of programming
    languages (including VB6) and had his first contact with Ruby back in 2009 when he was
    hired to work remotely on Open Source projects for a company from the U.S. After strugling
    to be productive with Ruby on Windows, he switched to Linux and ended up falling in love with
    open source, having contributions submitted and accepted to a project on the "pre-GitHub" ages.
  - As a hobby, he likes to spend some time "just chillin" on a hammock, enjoys beers from
    all over the world and contributes with open source projects.
