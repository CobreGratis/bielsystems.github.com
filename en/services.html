      <h3 id="continuado">Continuous Delivery</h3>
      <p>We turn your ideas into web products, from zero to millions of users!</p>
      <p>We set up a team for your project that can start with a minimum of 2 people and can have as many as required, according to your needs.</p>
      <p>The team works exclusively, not being shared among more than one project.</p>
      <p>Our contract is week to week and can be canceled at any time. You can hire just one week to test our services and choose to continue or not. The team can also be increased or decreased at any time.</p>
      <p>Web projects take 2 weeks to 12 weeks in general to reach the point of being launched. This is also the maximum time that we give to any client to launch the project or go to production. Products that work tend to require continuous development forever until they are disabled.</p>
      <p>Our interest is to always deliver the best results, because we know that customer interest in continuing to work with us depends on the results of the deliveries of our team.</p>
      <p>We work with weekly iterations. In a standard four-week month, we delivered four versions of the software. Our work process is based on eXtreme Programming. <a href="/en/magic">See more details of the methodology</a>.</p>
      <p>The team works exclusively on your project from Monday to Thursday. That's because we are completely transparent. Internal team meetings and investments are made exclusively on Fridays. We give the assurance that the work period is totally dedicated to your project.</p>
