    <ul class="column-01">
      <li>
        <h3>Freedom</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone is free and should be so in their professional relations as well. We believe that everyone working
          with us needs to feel at liberty to express themselves, disagree, suggest or change at any particular moment. And we remind everybody that with freedom comes responsibility.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Transparency</h3>
        <p>Our relations are guided by transparency while always respecting everyone’s privacy. We do not worry about hiding our numbers and are transparent about the company’s real situation every moment.</p>
      </li>
        <h3>Autonomy</h3>
        <p>Those that work with us have autonomy to decide how to get stuff done in their own way, from technical to social circumstances. Some people, for example, come to work wearing shorts, others don’t even show up and remain working from home (remotely).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Self-organizing teams</h3>
        <p>We don’t have managers or middlemen. Our clients speak directly with our technical team, which in turn, are prepared to help and advise with excellence. We are programmers, designers and nerds, and we're capable of communicating and organizing ourselves very well. The teams find their own way of working, and do so without a boss or senior management.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Awesomeness</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, the word “work” has taken on a shady and pejorative sense in Brazil. Some people go as far as to say they “go to war" when referring to their workplace. We think this view is very sad and that it doesn’t make any sense. To us, work and fun are almost synonyms. We mix everything, and at times, find ourselves playing throughout the day and working at night. We tend to say we have this “awesomeness” that in no way can be lost or sacrificed. There’s something different here, that no one wants to forget and we all really enjoy.  We really appreciate being together and playing together while creating. In the office, we have a pinball machine, R/C cars & helicopters, and other stuff like sweets, snacks, sodas, beer and Red Bull.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>
        <h3>Continual Improvement</h3>
        <p>We will never get it right the first time we try it. No one does. We’re always ready to change very quickly and improve what we build. And we are aware that work needs to be done in an iterative and incremental fashion, for that will yield outstanding results. We conduct retrospective meetings covering absolutely everything we do, discussing positive points and areas of improvement for the company.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        <p>Collaboration is an essential requirement for teamwork.  Knowing this makes it easy to have cooperative relationships within the team. And our collaborative spirit expands even beyond company boundaries. We invest a great deal of effort to get involved in external projects, be them events, apps or ideas to help change the world.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Trust</h3>
        <p>Above all, we value people. We trust those whom we interact with. Even when in doubt, we trust. We trust the result of everyone’s work and respect their decisions. We don’t command and control, the absence of a main authority figure reflects this. We know we must be aligned on the purposes and can trust our team partners in this way so our results will be the best.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Courage</h3>
        <p>Beyond all, we need courage to do what we do. Here we get it done differently and sail against the tide. Our vision goes beyond common sense. To implement our beliefs, it’s necessary a bit of courage every day at work. We have enough of it to make a difference, to invent and innovate. We also use it to say no to clients and to decline doing things we know will be harmful, even if they think the opposite.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Happiness</h3>
        <p>The objective of us working is so we become happier and amaze the world. We love what we do and this feeling is the motivating factor for building stuff that makes a difference to us, our clients and partners. We always ask our clients whether, beyond satisfied, they are happy with the result of our work. To us, this is the most relevant aspect of a job well done. We feel an extreme sense of accomplishment when we complete assignments that provided a sense of happiness to those involved.</p>
